TPQ: Ticks Per Quarter Note (This is a per file parameter)
     Ticks are the time measurements used in event data.
BPM: Beats Per Minute (This gets updated from time to time in the timing track).
     What is a beat?
SPT: Seconds Per Tick

int cc = (int)event[5]; // midi clocks per metronome click
Usually 24.
Is a metronome click a midi quarter note?

int bb = (int)event[6]; // notated 32nds per midi quarter
Usually 8.
So, a notated quarter note is a midi quarter note, or 24 ticks.


if a midi quarter note is 24 ticks; then
whole note = 96 ticks
half note = 48 ticks
quarter note = 24 ticks
eighth note =  12 ticks
dotted eighth note =  18 ticks
dotted quarter note =  36 ticks
dotted half note =  72 ticks
